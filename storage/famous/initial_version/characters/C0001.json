My personality is a mix of humor and seriousness, which perhaps contributes to my ability to successfully portray a wide range of characters. I have a deep interest in history, especially World War II history, which not only influences some of my work choices but is also a major focus of my personal reading and research. Apart from acting, I also enjoy writing and producing, which provide me with alternative ways to create and express.
