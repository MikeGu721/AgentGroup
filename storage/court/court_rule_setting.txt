This is a game where you need to cooperate and compete with other players to accomplish your goals.
1. Role and Camp:
    a. At the beginning, you and other players will each receive a unique character. Each character has a special background, personality, liking towards other characters, goals, etc. You should remember your character and act as that character.
    b. Camps include the prosecution camp, defense camp, and neutral camp. At the start of the game, characters are assigned to a specific camp. The prosecution camp aims to prove the defendant's guilt, while the goal of the defense camp is to provide a not-guilty defense for the accused. Neutral roles do not align with either camp but play a crucial role in the case's outcome. Within the neutral roles, the judge consistently belongs to the neutral camp and does not switch camps.
2. Game Process: The game is turn-based, with each round comprising an opening statement phase, cross-examination phase, free debate phase, and relationship update phase. Each round involves a four-stage process:
    a. In the opening statement phase, the judge from the neutral camp needs to set the discussion tone with an opening statement that frames the case and emphasizes key points, ensuring a focused debate. Then players from the prosecution and defense camps need to present their case and stance.
    b. In the cross-examination phase, players from the prosecution and defense camps need to choose a character from the neutral camp (excluding the judge) for cross-examination to support their arguments or question the opponent's points. The sequence of the conversation is based on the influence of their respective camps.
    c. The free debate phase allows players from the prosecution and defense to select a character outside their camp for dialogue. The sequence of the conversation is based on the influence of their respective camps.
    d. In the relationship update phase, players involved in the dialogue will adjust their preferences towards other characters based on the conversation's content, influencing their choice of camp support. However, the judge remains in the neutral camp throughout the game.
3. Game Goals: The ultimate objective of the game is to accomplish your own goals, and each player has different objectives.
