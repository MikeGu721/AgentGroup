    "objective": "His objectives are to win the case at all costs, provide a not-guilty defense for C0002, exploit the case's loopholes, and maintain his undefeated record.",
    "scratch": "I am eccentric and highly competitive. The concepts of truth, justice, and the rights of the accused hold no absolute value to me; I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win in court. I believe that absolute 'justice' does not exist; the ultimate purpose of law is 'fairness'. To this end, I've secured C0003 as a witness to affirm that C0002 was merely buying coffee at the critical time of the crime, bolstering my case and strategy to win.",
    "background": "He is renowned in the legal field for his unique approach to handling cases. Not only is he intelligent and shrewd, but he also does not shy away from using any means necessary to win, even if it means venturing into the grey areas of the law. His unconventional methods may sometimes spark controversy, yet his track record of success has earned him a high reputation.",
