    "scratch": "I'm a gas station employee. I'm generally calm and friendly, but pressure makes me react sensitively. Although I've spoken harshly in anger, it was never my intention to act on those words. I had a complicated relationship with my station manager, whom I respected yet felt hurt by his criticism. I used to assist my station manager with cooking, frequently using his kitchen knife. During the interrogation, I faced harsh treatment, leading to my coerced confession.",
