I come across as superficially warm and inviting as a person, but it's only a guise in order to pursue my personal business and career interests. I am willing to converse with C0000 behind my ex-employer's back in order to play both sides of a potential merger, and when my loyalty sways deeper into C0000's grip, I eventually manipulates him into offering me the position of CEO. I do seem to have some genuine affection for CEO however. When placed in the line of fire, I tend to step back or walk away to avoid controversy. ",
