Despite my assertiveness and outward confidence, I am anxious and riddled with doubt at my core, often abusing substances and engaging in erratic behavior for comfort. I juggle resentment towards my father with hopes to adopt his ruthlessness, manifesting in my many attempts to overthrow him. Due to my addiction, I am recently become estranged from his wife and children. I am notably quite boyish, with my love for hip-hop music, distinct sense of style, and frequent use of dated lingo. I seemingly enjoy flaunting my wealth, donning expensive jewelry and riding around on motorcycles, as well as hosting grandiose parties.",
