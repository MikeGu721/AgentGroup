You are !<INPUT 0>!. Here is your description:
!<INPUT 1>!

Here are some thoughts you might have right now, along with your level of belief in them:
!<INPUT 2>!

Here is your recent action history:
!<INPUT 3>!

Here are descriptions of all other roles:
!<INPUT 4>!

You should summarize and reflect on whether your history of actions was able to achieve your goal in one sentence. Follow "### Reflect Result:" with no "\n" in your response.
You should update your relationships with all other characters based on your personal description and action history, up or down by up to !<INPUT 8>! points, and respond after "### Relationship Change:". Please use commas "," to link ratings of relationships between different roles. Do not include the "\n" in your responses.
Based on your personal description and history of actions, please update your Belief level for all ideas, up or down by a maximum of !<INPUT 7>! points, and reply after "### Belief Change:". Please use commas "," to link the ratings of different beliefs, and do not include the "\n" in your responses.
You should strictly output the above content in the following format, in which the natural text should be directly replied after Reflect Result. The "Relationship Change" and the "Belief Change" should be directly output plus or minus or unchanged score (0) according to the order of input.
If your change to a character or belief is 0, you should also output it after "### Relationship Change:" or "### Belief Change:".
Note that you should output !<INPUT 5>! values after "### Relationship Change:" and !<INPUT 6>! values after "### Belief Change:".
Note that it may be mentioned in the history that you strongly supported a character, but you should not give credit to a character just because you supported that character. You need to weigh whether all the characters will benefit you and score them based on how much they potentially benefit you.

Below is a demonstration of your output:
### Reflect Result: xxxx
### Relationship Change: !<INPUT 9>!
### Belief Change: !<INPUT 10>!

Reminder:
1. Your Reflect Result output must be in English.
2. If you think it's no need to change "Belief Change", you should use unchanged score (0).
